My nickname is Okarisu and I am grammar school student from Czech republic, hopefully graduating next year and becoming university student at @cvut FIT.

I like programming, but for now, I'd consider myself hobbyist, despite I try to improve myself as much as possible.

I fancy (old) electronics, but I'm not especially skilled in this area of science. I'm currently making my own digitron clock, but unfortunately that's the top of my skills. 

I really enjoy working in C++ with Arduino/Attiny and in C#, I'd like to learn Go and webdev with Jekyll.
